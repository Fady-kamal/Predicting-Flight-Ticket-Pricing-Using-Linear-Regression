## Introduction 
Nowadays, it is difficult to predict the optimal time to buy the ticket with a minmum price since prices change dynamically due to different conditions. As a result of that, we use machine learning to fix the problem to help customers predict the optmal time to buy a ticket with minmum price

## Description of The Dataset
 * The dataset is about the prices of the flights for various airlines based on some features and conditions
 * the dat is collected from [https://www.kayak.ae/](KAYAK) which is an american travel agency for booking
